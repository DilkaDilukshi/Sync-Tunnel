# Sync-Tunnel
Backup Software made with Python that utilizes pre-existing cloud storage providers

The backup software will allow certain folders to be selected then a set time, eg per week, the software would automatically compress the folders then upload them to a chosen cloud service, eg Google Drive. This will set this software apart from others as it will be free, have a good UI and be easy to use/maintain.
Some important ideas are:
- A "one-time setup" meaning users should never have to open the software after setup.
- Lightweight, meaning the program is small and robust.
- Optimal network/system performance, not noticeably affecting the user's experience.
